Marko Trajkovski is a baritone recognized for his rich vocal timbre, dramatic versatility, and artistic curiosity. He graduated in solo singing from the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna (MDW), one of Europe’s most esteemed music institutions. During his studies, he brought to life a wide spectrum of operatic characters, including Figaro (Le Nozze di Figaro), Schaunard (La Bohème), Talbot (Maria Stuarda), Alidoro (La Cenerentola), Dancaïro (Carmen), and roles in Carl Orff’s opera Die Kluge (The Wise One).

In recent years, Marko has established himself as a compelling presence on the opera stage. His 2023 performance as Leporello in Mozart’s Don Giovanni with the Montenegrin Symphony Orchestra in Podgorica, under Marc Korovich and stage direction by Aleksandar Nikolić, was met with great critical and audience acclaim for his vocal depth and charismatic interpretation.

He made his debut at the Theater an der Wien in 2022 as Ufficiale in Rossini’s The Barber of Seville, and performed in the original Austrian musical The Dead Class (2022), which received the Austrian Music Theatre Award in 2023 for Best Music in the Musical category.

Marko has also appeared in the Vienna State Opera‘s production of Animal Farm by Aleksandar Raskatov and performed leading operetta roles at the Léhár Festival in Bad Ischl, including Madame Pompadour, The World Is Already Here, and The Bird Seller. His 2022 solo recital, Lichter (Lights), at the Jesuit Church Dome in Vienna showcased a bold selection of contemporary and expressive art song, in collaboration with the INMUAS association.

In 2024, he joined the Theater in der Josefstadt as a guest soloist in the role of Linarius, the ghost from the Alps, in the new production Alpenkönig und Menschenfeind. He also continues to appear as a concert soloist, with performances including Anton Bruckner’s Requiem and Te Deum at the Klosterneuburg Cultural Center under Michael Schnedl, and Bach’s St. John Passion as Pontius Pilate at the Korkyra Baroque Festival in Croatia.

Marko frequently performs in sacred and concert venues such as Klosterneuburg Monastery, Getvaig Monastery, Scots Church, and the Schönbrunn Palace Theater. He has studied with renowned artists including Marijana Mijanović, Christoph Maier, Charles Spencer, Markus Hadulla, and Jürgen Goriup, and his work with Linda Plech and Jürgen Goriup at the Léhár Festival was instrumental in expanding his reach into musical theatre and dramatic stage work.
