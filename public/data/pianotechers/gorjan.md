Gorjan Stojanovski — Pianist, Conductor & Music Educator

Gorjan Stojanovski is an inspiring young pianist, conductor, and music educator whose artistry and dedication continue to earn acclaim on both national and international stages. His musical journey began in his hometown of Bitola, where the city’s rich cultural spirit ignited his passion. He completed his early piano studies at the State Music School in Bitola with Prof. Dr. Tatjana Božinovska, later continuing at DMBUC “Ilija Nikolovski–Luj” in Skopje under Mr. Dino Imeri and Ms. Katarina Ćetković–Fidanovska.

A laureate of multiple competitions, Gorjan’s accolades include:
• Third prize at Davorin Jenko (Belgrade, 2020)
• Second prize at the Chopin Competition (Malaysia, 2020)
• First prize and special award for best Beethoven interpretation at Polyhymnia
• First prize in Idrija, Slovenia (2021)
• First prize at the national competition of the Association of Music and Ballet Pedagogues “Harmonia” (2021)

A defining highlight of Gorjan’s career so far was his solo recital at the prestigious Concerti del Tempietto festival in Rome (2024), where his performance was praised for its maturity, sensitivity, and powerful artistic voice.

Alongside his piano career, Gorjan is building a reputation as a promising conductor. He has studied with Maestro Timothy Redmond (UK) and Prof. Uroš Lajovic (Slovenia), conducting the Symphony Orchestra of the Plovdiv Opera and the FAMES Orchestra in Skopje — remarkable achievements for such a young artist. His conducting is marked by precision, expressiveness, and a deep respect for the orchestral sound.

Since 2022, he has been studying piano at the Faculty of Music in Skopje in the class of Prof. Elena Atanasovska Ivanovska, while continuing to refine his skills as both pianist and conductor.

As a teacher, Gorjan is passionate about sharing his knowledge and love for music. His teaching style is thoughtful, clear, and engaging — aiming not only to build technical skill but also to inspire deeper understanding. He teaches music history, theory, harmony, and related subjects, always seeking to connect the dots between knowledge and artistry. His students describe him as patient, encouraging, and able to make even complex concepts accessible and fascinating.

For Gorjan, music is more than a profession — it is a journey of discovery and a silent language that speaks directly to the soul.
