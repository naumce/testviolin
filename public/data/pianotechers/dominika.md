Dominika Robe Popovska is an award-winning pianist, educator, and collaborative artist with over a decade of experience teaching students of all ages and levels. Known for her engaging and holistic teaching approach, Dominika combines high-level musical training with a deep commitment to student growth, artistry, and enjoyment of music.

She began studying piano at the age of five and quickly distinguished herself through numerous competition wins and festival performances. She holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Piano Performance, having graduated first in her class with the highest honors. Her academic and artistic excellence earned her invitations to perform in renowned international projects and festivals across Europe and the U.S.

Dominika later pursued a second Master’s degree in Piano Performance at Florida Atlantic University, where she studied under the guidance of Dr. Irena Kofman. During this time, she further developed her teaching philosophy, blending European traditions of musical discipline and depth with a modern, student-centered approach.

Over the past 10+ years, Dominika has taught in a variety of settings—music schools, universities, and private studios—working with young beginners, advanced pianists, and adult learners alike. Her students regularly receive top prizes at competitions, and consistently earn the highest ratings at festivals and juried performances. Many have gone on to study music at competitive institutions and programs.

In addition to teaching, Dominika is a highly sought-after collaborative pianist and vocal coach, working regularly with singers, instrumentalists, and choirs. She has appeared as a soloist and chamber musician at major festivals such as Skopje Summer Festival, Ohrid Summer Festival, Autumn Music Gala, and Bitola Summer Festival, and was a featured performer in the international concert series “European Piano Reflections,” presented in France, Poland, Austria, Moldova, and other countries.

Her repertoire spans from Baroque to contemporary music, and her performances are praised for their sensitivity, clarity, and expressive depth.

As a teacher, Dominika is committed to making lessons both rigorous and joyful. She integrates theory, history, and interpretation into her lessons, and often uses contemporary materials and methods to keep students motivated and engaged. Her goal is not just to teach students how to play, but to help them become thoughtful, confident musicians with a lifelong love for music.
