Simon Popovski – Violinist & Educator

Simon Popovski is a dynamic violinist and dedicated educator whose artistry bridges the worlds of performance and pedagogy. With a career spanning continents and genres, he is recognized for his expressive playing, refined technique, and thoughtful musical interpretation.

He began studying violin at the age of eight under the guidance of Vancho Stoilkov. His formal education includes a Bachelor’s degree (2014) and Master’s degree (2018) in violin performance from the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius, and a second Master’s degree (2022) from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, USA. His musical growth has been shaped through mentorship and masterclasses with renowned artists such as Mei Mei Luo, Sihana Badivuku, Oleg Kondratenko, Blagoj Dimchevski, Susan Gilmore, and Pavel Vernikov.

Simon has received numerous awards at national and international competitions in both solo and chamber music. His first orchestral experience came in 2007 with the World Youth Symphony Orchestra, performing across the United States—an experience that sparked a lifelong passion for orchestral collaboration.

As an orchestral musician, he has performed with prominent ensembles including the Palm Beach Opera, Atlantic Symphony, Boca Symphonia, Miami City Ballet, and the F.A.M.E. film music recording orchestra. His versatility extends to chamber music, where he has made significant contributions as a member of ensembles such as Con Tempora (over 40 concerts), the Axios String Quartet, and Viva Strings. His solo appearances feature a wide-ranging repertoire from classical and sacred works to jazz and contemporary music, and he has participated in several ballet productions interpreting the music of Igor Stravinsky.

Simon has appeared as a soloist with numerous orchestras, including the Youth Orchestra of the region, the Chamber and Symphony Orchestras of the Faculty of Music – Skopje, the Bitola Chamber Orchestra, and ensembles at Florida Atlantic University and the First Presbyterian Church in Florida.

A seasoned international performer, he has played in the United States, United Arab Emirates, Austria, Spain, Albania, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, China, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Kosovo, Romania, and Bulgaria. His festival appearances include Skopje Summer, Bitola Summer, Interfest, Ohrid Summer, Autumn Music Festivities, KotorArt, and others.

In addition to his performing career, Simon is deeply committed to music education. With years of teaching experience across different age groups and levels, he fosters a nurturing and inspiring learning environment that emphasizes a strong technical foundation, stylistic understanding, and a genuine love for music. His students have gone on to achieve notable successes, and he is praised for his patient, encouraging approach and ability to adapt to each learner’s individual needs.

Simon currently holds a position as violinist with the Chamber Orchestra of Bitola, while continuing to teach, mentor, and perform both locally and internationally.
